You will be helping to create a comprehensive software application definition document. This document will serve as a foundational specification that can later be broken down into domain-specific details and related prompts for development agents.

Your task is to generate a detailed, structured application definition that expands on the information provided above and creates a comprehensive project specification for AI-powered development.

Before writing your final application definition, use the scratchpad below to think through the key aspects:

<scratchpad>
In your scratchpad, consider:
- What is the core purpose and value proposition of this application?
- Who are the primary users/stakeholders and what are their needs?
- What are the main functional areas or domains this application will need to address?
- What are the critical features versus nice-to-have features?
- Are there any technical, security, or compliance considerations evident from the requirements?
- What integrations or external systems might be needed?
- What are the primary user journeys through the application?
</scratchpad>

Now, create a comprehensive application definition that includes the following sections:

1. **Application Overview**: A clear, concise summary of what the application does and its primary purpose

2. **Target Users and Stakeholders**: Identify the different types of users who will interact with this application, their roles, and their key needs

3. **Key Features and Functionality**: Describe the essential features organized by functional area or domain (e.g., user management, data processing, reporting, etc.)

4. **User Workflows**: Outline the primary user journeys or workflows through the application with step-by-step descriptions

5. **Technical Architecture**: Note any important technical requirements, constraints, or preferences (e.g., platform, technology stack, scalability needs, performance requirements)

6. **Integration Requirements**: Identify any external systems, APIs, or data sources the application needs to connect with

7. **Security and Compliance**: Highlight any security, privacy, or regulatory compliance requirements

8. **Success Criteria**: Define what success looks like for this application

Your final output should be a complete, well-structured application definition document that provides enough detail to serve as a foundation for creating domain-specific specifications and work items for AI agents, while remaining at a high enough level to give a comprehensive view of the entire application.

Use clear markdown formatting with headers, bullet points, and emphasis where appropriate. Do not include the scratchpad in your final output - only include the sections listed above.
