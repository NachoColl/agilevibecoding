## Post Body

### 👋 Welcome to the Agile Vibe Coding Community!

Hey everyone! Welcome to **r/AgileVibeCoding** – a community for developers, teams, and AI enthusiasts exploring the future of software development with AI coding agents.

If you're here, you probably share our curiosity about building complex software with LLMs, managing long-running AI agent projects, or simply want to learn how to work more effectively with tools like Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other AI coding assistants.

### 🎯 What Is Agile Vibe Coding?

**Agile Vibe Coding (AVC)** is an open-source framework and CLI tool designed for managing AI-agent-based software development projects. Think of it as "Agile for AI agents" – a structured approach to breaking down large projects into verifiable, trackable work items that AI coding agents can implement consistently over weeks or months.

**The Challenge We're Solving:**

Large software projects stress LLM-based coding agents in ways that differ from human development:
- LLMs don't retain long-term memory
- Context windows have limits, causing coherence to degrade
- Without structure, AI agents drift, duplicate logic, and introduce regressions

**Our Solution:**

AVC provides:
- 📋 **Hierarchical work breakdown** (Epic → Story → Task → Subtask)
- 🧠 **Context at every level** that inherits from parent levels
- ✅ **Two-stage validation** (implementation + testing)
- 🔄 **Parallel execution** without merge conflicts
- 📊 **Progress tracking** that persists across sessions
- 🎯 **Specialized ceremonies** (like "Sponsor Call" for project initialization)

### Title: Welcome to Agile Vibe Coding! 🚀

**Body:**

Hey everyone! Welcome to r/AgileVibeCoding – where we explore building software with AI coding agents.

**What is AVC?**
An open-source framework for managing long-running AI agent projects. We break down complex builds into structured work items that AI agents (Claude, GPT, Cursor) can implement consistently over weeks or months.

**Why it matters:**
LLMs don't have long-term memory. Without structure, they drift, duplicate code, and create regressions. AVC provides hierarchical context, parallel execution, and progress tracking.

**Get started:**
```bash
npm install -g @agile-vibe-coding/avc
```
